            We believe beauty should never come at the cost of the environment, which is why we blend science with nature 
            to deliver formulas that are gentle, effective, and sustainably sourced.

        <h2>Ingredients You Can Trust</h2>
        <p>
            Transparency matters. Every product we create is crafted using natural botanicals such as green tea, 
            chamomile, rose water, aloe vera, and jojoba — chosen for their soothing and hydrating properties. 
            We work hard to help you understand what goes on your skin, why it works, and how it supports your natural glow.
